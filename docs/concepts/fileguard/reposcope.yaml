# Auto-generated by assess-complexity workflow
# This file provides repository context for downstream AI planning workflows.
#
# The top-level fields mirror the RepoScope CRD struct 1:1.
# The greenfield_implications section is an AI-ONLY superset -- it contains
# derived guidance for downstream AI workflows (PRD, HLD, LLD) that is NOT
# stored in the CRD. This avoids bloating the K8s API with AI prompt hints.
