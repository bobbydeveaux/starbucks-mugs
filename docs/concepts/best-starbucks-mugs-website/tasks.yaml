- Features:
  - FeatureID: best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-filter-search
    FeatureTitle: Filter Bar & Search Engine
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Filter bar section renders above the mug grid with all specified controls
        (search, series select, year min/max, reset button)
      - Results count paragraph with aria-live polite is present below the filter
        bar
      - Filter bar is styled and visually coherent with the existing site design
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: 'Insert the #filter-bar section into index.html between the header
        and main, including search input, series dropdown, year-range inputs, reset
        button, and results-count paragraph. Add corresponding CSS for the filter
        bar layout, empty-state, and placeholder styles to style.css.'

      ID: task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-filter-search-1
      Title: Add filter bar HTML and CSS
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - filterMugs() correctly AND-combines query substring match (name/series/region/tags),
        exact series equality, and inclusive year-range filtering
      - Typing in search input debounces at 200ms; series and year inputs trigger
        applyFilters immediately; reset button clears all filter state and re-renders
        full catalog
      - Series dropdown is populated dynamically from the loaded catalog with no duplicate
        values
      - Results count text updates on every filter change and reflects filtered vs
        total count
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-filter-search-1
      Description: Add module-level allMugs and filterState variables. Implement filterMugs()
        (pure function with AND-combined query/series/year-range matching), debounce()
        utility, applyFilters(), populateSeriesFilter(), and updateResultsCount().
        Update loadMugs() to populate allMugs, call populateSeriesFilter, and wire
        search (debounced), select, number inputs, and reset button to applyFilters.
        Add tests for filterMugs() and debounce() in app.test.js.

  Sprint: 2
- Features:
  - FeatureID: best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-modal-image
    FeatureTitle: Enhanced Modal & Image Fallback
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - images/placeholder.svg exists and renders a recognizable cup silhouette at
        ~400 bytes
      - Cards with broken image src display placeholder.svg instead of a broken image
        icon
      - Modal opened for a mug with missing image also displays placeholder.svg
      - onerror handler sets img.onerror = null to prevent infinite fallback loops
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create images/placeholder.svg as a ~400-byte inline SVG cup silhouette.
        Add img.onerror handlers in both createCard and openModal in app.js so any
        missing image falls back to images/placeholder.svg without infinite loops.
      EstimatedEffort: S
      Files:
      - images/placeholder.svg
      - app.js
      ID: task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-modal-image-1
      Title: Add placeholder SVG and image onerror fallback
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Modal displays series, year, region, edition, material, capacity_oz, price_usd,
        and tags for every mug entry
      - Fields with missing/undefined values are omitted or shown as a dash rather
        than 'undefined'
      - Modal detail layout is visually structured (labels aligned, tags displayed
        as chips or comma-separated)
      - No existing modal functionality (close button, image display) is broken
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Update openModal in app.js to render all metadata fields (series,
        year, region, edition, material, capacity_oz, price_usd, tags) in a structured
        definition-list or grid layout. Add corresponding CSS in style.css for the
        modal detail section so fields are clearly labeled and readable.
