- Features:
  - FeatureID: best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-catalog-data
    FeatureTitle: Expanded Mug Catalog Data
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - 'mugs.json root is { version: ''1.0'', mugs: [...] } and validates as valid
        JSON'
      - 'All entries have price_usd (no price field remains) and required fields:
        id, name, series, year, region, price_usd, description, image, tags'
      - Catalog contains 50 or more entries distributed across the seven named series
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Restructure mugs.json root from a bare array to { version, mugs[]
        }, rename price to price_usd on all existing entries, and add series/year/region/edition/material/capacity_oz/tags
        fields. Expand catalog from 6 to 50+ entries spanning City, Holiday, You Are
        Here, Reserve, Siren, Anniversary, and Dot Collection series.

      ID: task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-catalog-data-1
      Title: Expand mugs.json to versioned envelope schema with 50+ entries
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - loadMugs() returns a consistent { version, mugs } object whether mugs.json
        uses the new envelope or legacy bare array
      - Mug cards display prices correctly using price_usd; no references to mug.price
        remain in app.js
      - Network failure and HTTP error paths still render the existing grid-error
        message
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-catalog-data-1
      Description: Update loadMugs() to parse the new { version, mugs[] } envelope
        with a legacy bare-array fallback. Update all app.js references from mug.price
        to mug.price_usd so price display remains correct.

- Features:
  - FeatureID: best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-filter-search
    FeatureTitle: Filter Bar & Search Engine
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - '#filter-bar section renders visibly above the mug grid with all controls
        present'
      - '#results-count element has aria-live=''polite'' and aria-atomic=''true''
        attributes'
      - Filter bar is responsive and styled consistently with the existing site design
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: 'Insert the #filter-bar section into index.html between the header
        and main content, including search input, series dropdown, year-range inputs,
        reset button, and results-count paragraph. Add corresponding filter bar, empty-state,
        and results count styles to style.css.'
      EstimatedEffort: S
      Files:
      - index.html
      - style.css
      ID: task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-filter-search-1
      Title: Add filter bar HTML and CSS
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - filterMugs() correctly filters by case-insensitive query substring across
        name/series/region/tags, exact series match, and inclusive year range
      - Search input uses debounced applyFilters (200ms); select and number inputs
        call applyFilters directly
      - Series dropdown is populated dynamically from loaded mug data with an 'All
        Series' default option
      - Results count displays filtered vs total count and updates on every filter
        change; reset button restores all mugs
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-best-starbucks-mugs-website-feat-filter-search-1
      Description: Add allMugs and filterState module-level state, implement filterMugs()
        as a pure function with AND-combined query/series/year-range matching, implement
        debounce() utility, and implement applyFilters(), populateSeriesFilter(),
        and updateResultsCount(). Update loadMugs() to handle versioned envelope with
        legacy-array fallback. Wire all filter control event listeners.
