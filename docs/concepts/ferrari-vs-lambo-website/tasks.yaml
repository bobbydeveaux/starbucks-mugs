- Features:
  - FeatureID: ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-data-foundation
    FeatureTitle: Static Data, Types & App Shell
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - CarModel interface is exported from src/types.ts with all fields required
        by the JSON data (id, brand, model, year, price, specs, imageUrl, etc.)
      - Existing Drink and Brand types remain untouched and the file compiles with
        no TypeScript errors
      - At least one related interface (e.g., CompareResult or CatalogFilter) is defined
        for downstream hook use
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Append CarModel and related interfaces (e.g., BrandMeta, CompareResult)
        to src/types.ts without modifying existing Drink/Brand types. These types
        serve as the canonical schema for all car data and hook contracts in the feature.

      Title: Define CarModel types and interfaces
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - ferrari.json contains ≥50 records, each valid against the CarModel schema
        (no missing required fields)
      - lamborghini.json contains ≥30 records, each valid against the CarModel schema
      - Both files are served correctly from the Vite dev server under /data/ and
        can be fetched via fetch('/data/ferrari.json') without 404
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-data-foundation-1
      Description: Create public/data/ferrari.json with ≥50 production Ferrari models
        and public/data/lamborghini.json with ≥30 production Lamborghini models, each
        record conforming to the CarModel schema defined in task-1. Data should cover
        a realistic spread of model years and variants.

      Title: Author static car catalog JSON data
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - tailwind.config.ts exports ferrari-red and lambo-yellow tokens usable as bg-ferrari-red
        and text-lambo-yellow; existing starbucks/costa tokens are unchanged
      - Navigating to /ferrari, /lamborghini, and /compare renders the correct placeholder
        or stub component without a console error
      - vercel.json CSP headers allow fetch() to /data/*.json and do not break the
        existing Costa vs Starbucks route at /
      - react-router-dom@6 is the only new dependency added to package.json

      Dependencies: []
      Description: Append car-related types (Car, CarBrand, filter/sort options) to
        src/types.ts without touching existing Drink/Brand types. Implement useCarCatalog
        hook mirroring the useDrinks pattern — fetch ferrari.json and lamborghini.json
        from public/data/ via fetch(), expose filtered and sorted car arrays, and
        add eraMatchSuggestion pure utility. Add ferrari-red and lambo-yellow tokens
        to tailwind.config.ts.

      Description: Build CarCard as a top-trump-style stat card displaying image,
        HP, torque, 0-60, top speed, and engine config using the ferrari-red/lambo-yellow
        Tailwind tokens. Build CatalogPage consuming useCarCatalog to list both brand
        catalogs chronologically with card thumbnails, wired to the react-router-dom
        route added in the data foundation.

  - FeatureID: ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-filtering-search
    FeatureTitle: Era Filter & Search
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Selecting a decade in EraFilter reduces both Ferrari and Lamborghini catalog
        results to models from that decade
      - Selecting 'All' resets both catalogs to their full lists
      - useCarCatalog exposes era state and setter consumed by EraFilter
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Build the EraFilter component as a decade selector (e.g. 1960s–2020s)
        that simultaneously narrows both Ferrari and Lamborghini catalogs. Extend
        useCarCatalog to accept and apply an era filter parameter, ensuring filtered
        results update both catalog lists in sync.
      EstimatedEffort: S
      Files:
      - src/components/EraFilter.tsx
      - src/hooks/useCarCatalog.ts
      ID: task-ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-filtering-search-1
      Title: Implement EraFilter decade selector with useCarCatalog integration
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Typing a model name filters both catalogs within 300 ms of the user stopping
        input
      - Search and era filters compose correctly (era + search term both applied simultaneously)
      - Clearing the search input restores the full (or era-filtered) catalog without
        delay
      - Debounce is implemented without external libraries (useRef + setTimeout or
        equivalent)
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-filtering-search-1
      Description: Build the SearchBar component with a debounced input (300 ms) that
        filters both catalogs by model name in real time. Wire the search term into
        useCarCatalog alongside the era filter so both filters compose correctly,
        and ensure the search clears gracefully when the input is emptied.

  - FeatureID: ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-comparison
    FeatureTitle: Comparison View & Era Rival Suggestion
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - eraMatchSuggestion returns the correct rival car object for a given selection
        using eraRivals ids
      - Returns null (or undefined) gracefully when no eraRivals entry exists for
        the selected car
      - Unit tests pass with 100% branch coverage for the utility
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Write the pure eraMatchSuggestion function that accepts a selected
        car and the full catalog, then returns the closest-year rival from the opposing
        brand by matching against pre-authored eraRivals ids in the JSON. Include
        a unit test file covering typical matches, missing eraRivals, and edge-year
        ties.

      ID: task-ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-comparison-1
      Title: Implement eraMatchSuggestion utility
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Hook correctly identifies the winning brand per stat and marks ties when values
        are equal
      - Changing either selected id updates derived winners without stale state
      - eraMatchSuggestion is called with the active selection and its result is exposed
        from the hook
      - RTL unit test covers stat-winner derivation and era suggestion integration
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-comparison-1
      Description: Create the useComparison hook that holds the selected Ferrari id
        and Lambo id in state, exposes setters, and derives per-stat winner labels
        (ferrari | lambo | tie) by comparing numeric stats across both car objects.
        The hook should return the two car objects, the derived winners map, and the
        era-suggested rival via eraMatchSuggestion.

      Title: Implement useComparison hook
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Winning stat cells render with the correct brand-colour highlight; tied cells
        are neutral
      - Selecting a car in either dropdown updates both the stat comparison and the
        era suggestion
      - Era suggestion button populates the opposing car selector with the suggested
        rival
      - ComparePage is accessible at its designated route and matches the LLD layout
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-ferrari-vs-lambo-website-feat-comparison-2
      Description: Implement ComparisonView as a side-by-side stat table where each
        winning cell is highlighted with the brand colour (ferrari-red or lambo-yellow
        Tailwind tokens). Wire ComparePage to useComparison, rendering car-selection
        dropdowns, the ComparisonView, and an era-suggestion prompt that auto-fills
        the opponent when triggered.
