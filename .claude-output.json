  "prTitle": "feat: extend TripwireRule with Protocol/Direction and add UDP port monitoring",
  "prBody": "## Summary\n\n- **Config** (`internal/config/config.go`): Added `Protocol` (`tcp`/`udp`/`both`, default `both`) and `Direction` (`inbound`/`outbound`/`both`, default `inbound`) fields to `TripwireRule` for NETWORK rules, with full validation — invalid values produce descriptive errors; FILE/PROCESS rules are unaffected\n- **NetworkWatcher** (`internal/agent/network_watcher.go`): Extended to monitor UDP ports by reading `/proc/net/udp` and `/proc/net/udp6`; added `ParseProcNetUdpFile` exported function; added `protocolMatches` helper; `matchAndEmit` now applies both protocol and direction filters\n- **Agent binary** (`cmd/agent/main.go`): Instantiates a `NetworkWatcher` for all NETWORK-type rules and registers it with the agent via `WithWatchers`\n- **Tests**: 12 new tests covering UDP socket parsing (bound/connected/inactive states), protocol filtering (tcp-only, udp-only, both), direction filtering (inbound vs outbound), Protocol/Direction config validation, and NETWORK rule defaults\n- **Docs**: Updated `agent-configuration.md` and `agent-core.md` to reflect the new fields, UDP monitoring behaviour, and binary wiring\n\nCloses #122",
