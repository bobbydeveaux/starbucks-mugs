  "explanation": "The requested functionality already exists with:\n- `fileguard/core/scan_context.py` — A fully-implemented `@dataclass` with fields: `file_bytes`, `mime_type`, `scan_id` (auto-UUID), `tenant_id`, `extracted_text`, `byte_offsets`, `findings`, `errors`, and `metadata`\n- Introduced in commit `f28edad4` as part of PR #299 (PIIDetector implementation)\n- Used by ScanPipeline, PIIDetector, DispositionEngine, and tested through `fileguard/tests/test_pipeline.py`\n- No changes are needed — the dataclass is complete, documented, and in active use",
