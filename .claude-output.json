  "prTitle": "feat: implement YAML config parsing and validation for tripwire agent",
  "prBody": "## Summary\n\n- Implement `agent/internal/config/config.go` with the full `AgentConfig` struct hierarchy covering: dashboard mTLS connection, file/network/process tripwire rules, local SQLite alert queue, SHA-256 chained audit log, structured logging, and `/healthz` health endpoint\n- `Parse`/`ParseFile` use `yaml.v3` strict decoding (`KnownFields(true)`) to reject unknown fields, and collect **all** validation errors at once so operators can fix every problem in a single run\n- Sensible defaults are applied (reconnect delays, log format, queue path, etc.) before validation\n- `Severity` values are case-insensitive and normalised to uppercase at parse time via a custom `yaml.Unmarshaler`\n- 31 table-driven unit tests cover: golden-path parsing, defaults, explicit overrides, every validation failure path (missing endpoint, bad host:port, non-existent cert files, reconnect_max < reconnect_delay, no rules, duplicate rule names, invalid events/protocols/directions/ports)\n- `cmd/tripwire/main.go` provides `start`, `validate`, and `version` subcommands\n- `config.example.yaml` serves as an annotated operator reference\n- Full field-level documentation added to `docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/agent-configuration.md`\n\nCloses #126",
