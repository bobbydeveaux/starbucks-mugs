  "prTitle": "feat: integrate file watcher with agent alert pipeline",
  "prBody": "## Summary\n\n- Implement `internal/watcher` package with cross-platform `FileWatcher` satisfying the `agent.Watcher` interface\n- Linux backend uses `inotify(7)` via `syscall` package (non-blocking, 50ms poll interval) supporting read/write/create/delete events\n- Non-Linux fallback uses 500ms polling via `os.Stat` to detect mtime/size changes\n- `FileWatcher` adds goroutine lifecycle management: automatic restart with exponential backoff (1s → 30s max) when the platform watcher errors, structured logging for dropped events\n- `cmd/agent/main.go` now calls `buildFileWatchers(cfg, logger)` to create one `FileWatcher` per `FILE`-type rule and registers them with the agent via `agent.WithWatchers`\n- Test suite covers: start/stop, 5s event delivery SLA, restart-on-error, context cancellation, interface compliance, and invalid glob handling\n- New doc `docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/file-watcher.md` covers the package API, platform implementations, goroutine lifecycle, configuration, and alert event format\n\nCloses #161",
