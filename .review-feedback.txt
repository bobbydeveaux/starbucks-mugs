## Code Review - Changes Requested

**Review decision: `changes_requested` / blocking issue flagged.**

The sole blocker is the accidental inclusion of `go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz` (69 MB binary). The developer needs to:

1. Remove the file from the branch (`git rm go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz`)
2. Add `*.tar.gz` to `.gitignore`
3. Force-push to rewrite the commit (or add a fixup commit) so the blob never enters `main`'s history

The `NetworkWatcher` code, tests, and documentation are well-done and will be ready to merge once the binary is removed.

**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
