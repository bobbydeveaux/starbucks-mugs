## Code Review - Changes Requested

The review is complete. The single blocking issue is a **test compilation failure**: `process_watcher_test.go` is in `package watcher` and calls `noopLogger()`, which is defined in `file_test.go` under the separate `package watcher_test`. Go's package system does not make symbols from the external test package visible to internal test files in the same directory, so `go test ./internal/watcher/...` will fail with `undefined: noopLogger`.

The fix is straightforward — add `noopLogger()` directly to `process_watcher_test.go` or a shared internal test helper file — but it must be done before the tests can be verified.

**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
