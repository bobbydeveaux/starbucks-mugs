## Code Review - Changes Requested

Review complete. The decision is **changes_requested** with blocking issues — the PR is a DRAFT with no test code written and failing CI across the board.

## ❌ BLOCKING ISSUES FOUND

**PR #331 — WIP: Implement Editor and Preview components**

---

### Summary

This PR is in **DRAFT** state and contains **no implementation**. The only change is deletion of `.claude-output.json` — a metadata artifact from a completely unrelated previous PR (the Celery scan worker task). The required components described in issue #326 do not exist anywhere in the repository.

---

### Blocking Issues

**1. Implementation is entirely missing**

The issue requires creating two files:
- `markdowntopdf/src/components/Editor.tsx`
- `markdowntopdf/src/components/Preview.tsx`

Neither file exists. The `markdowntopdf/` directory itself does not exist in the repository. The PR has **0 additions** and **20 deletions** (only the `.claude-output.json` removal).

**2. All CI checks are failing**

- **Build**: FAIL
- **Lint**: FAIL
- **Type Check**: FAIL

These failures confirm the implementation has not been delivered.

**3. Wrong `.claude-output.json` deleted**

The deleted file contained metadata referencing a Celery scan worker PR (issue #283), not this MarkdownToPDF task. This suggests the agent may have encountered an error mid-run and committed a partial/incorrect state.

### Acceptance Criteria Status

Per issue #326:

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| Editor renders a textarea with value/onChange props | Not implemented |
| Preview renders sanitized HTML via dangerouslySetInnerHTML | Not implemented |
| Preview forwards ref to wrapping div | Not implemented |
| Both components compile without TypeScript errors | Fails (no files to compile) |

---

### Required Actions

1. Create `markdowntopdf/src/components/Editor.tsx` with a controlled textarea accepting `value` and `onChange` props and explicit TypeScript interface.
2. Create `markdowntopdf/src/components/Preview.tsx` calling `parseMarkdown`, injecting via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and forwarding a ref to the wrapping div.
3. Ensure all CI checks pass before moving out of DRAFT.
4. Include a correct `.claude-output.json` reflecting the actual files changed in this task.

**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
