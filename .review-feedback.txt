## ❌ BLOCKING ISSUES FOUND

This PR changes the `mugs.json` data schema but does **not update `app.js`** to match. The result is a completely broken website at runtime — no mugs will render.

---

### Bug 1 — `loadMugs()` returns an envelope object, not an array (BLOCKING)

`app.js:129`:
```js
loadMugs()
  .then(renderCards)   // renderCards receives { version: "1.0", mugs: [...] }
```

`app.js:25-29` (`loadMugs`):
```js
return response.json();   // now returns { version, mugs[] }, not an array
```

`app.js:83`:
```js
mugs.forEach((mug) => { ... });   // TypeError: mugs.forEach is not a function
```

`renderCards` receives the envelope object and tries to call `.forEach()` on it. This throws immediately and the entire grid fails to render.

**Fix required**: `loadMugs()` must extract the array: `return response.json().then(data => data.mugs)`, or the bootstrap chain must be updated to `loadMugs().then(data => renderCards(data.mugs))`.

### Bug 2 — `mug.price` is used throughout `app.js` but the field is now `price_usd` (BLOCKING)

Even if Bug 1 were fixed, every card creation and modal display would crash:

- `app.js:42`: `aria-label: \`${mug.name}, $${mug.price.toFixed(2)}\``
- `app.js:59`: `price.textContent = \`$${mug.price.toFixed(2)}\``
- `app.js:98`: `modalPrice.textContent = \`$${mug.price.toFixed(2)}\``

`mug.price` is `undefined` in the new schema. Calling `undefined.toFixed(2)` throws `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')` on every card.

**Fix required**: Replace all `mug.price` references in `app.js` with `mug.price_usd`.

### Non-blocking: Test fixtures use old `price` field

`app.test.js:133-140` test fixtures still use `price: 12.95` instead of `price_usd`. The 19 tests all pass because they are self-contained, but they no longer exercise the real field name — meaning the regressions above aren't caught by CI.

### Non-blocking: JSDoc comments not updated

`app.js` lines 8, 34, and 91 still document the mug type as `{ price: number }` rather than `{ price_usd: number }`.

### Non-blocking: HLD ADR still says "6-item catalog"

`HLD.md:105`: *"Zero build tooling needed for a 6-item static catalog"* — still references the old 6-item count.

---

**Summary**: The data layer and consuming application are out of sync. The schema migration in `mugs.json` must be paired with corresponding changes to `app.js` (unwrap the envelope, rename the price field) and updated test fixtures before this can be merged.

**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
