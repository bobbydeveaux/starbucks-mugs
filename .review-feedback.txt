## Code Review - Changes Requested

**Review decision: `changes_requested` with blocking issues.**

The core problem is that this PR's description and claimed implementation are entirely disconnected from the actual diff. Only `.claude-output.json` was deleted — the entire dashboard UI feature (AlertFilters, useAlerts hook, FilterContext, API client, TypeScript types, and all 23 tests) is absent from the committed code. Merging would silently close #259 without delivering any of its requirements.

**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
