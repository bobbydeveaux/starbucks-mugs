// TripWire AlertService — gRPC service definition.
//
// Agents open a single bidirectional stream (StreamAlerts) to push alert
// events to the dashboard server.  Before streaming, an agent must call
// RegisterAgent to obtain its server-assigned host_id.
//
// Compile with:
//   protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
//          --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
//          proto/alert.proto
