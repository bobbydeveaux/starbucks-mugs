  "summary": "Resolved 3 metadata-only conflicts in .claude-output.json, .claude-resolution.json, and .conflict-info.json for PR #201. The actual source code changes (internal/watcher package, cmd/agent/main.go, docs) were already merged without conflicts. HEAD contained stale FileGuard DocumentExtractor metadata from a prior branch; origin/main contained the correct file-watcher integration metadata matching the staged files.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-output.json: chose origin/main version — it correctly describes the file watcher integration changes (internal/watcher package, cmd/agent/main.go, docs) that are staged on this branch, whereas HEAD contained unrelated DocumentExtractor metadata. For .claude-resolution.json: authored a fresh accurate summary since both sides contained stale descriptions from earlier resolutions on different branches. For .conflict-info.json: staged as-is since it already contained no conflict markers and correctly reflected PR #201."
