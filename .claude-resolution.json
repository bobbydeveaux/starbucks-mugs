  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes where possible: README merged all documentation sections from both branches into a coherent document; __init__.py chose the more descriptive HEAD docstring; test_clamav_adapter.py chose origin/main's version which tests the canonical newer adapter implementation (fileguard.core.adapters.clamav_adapter) that aligns with the AVEngineAdapter abstract interface defined in av_adapter.py"
