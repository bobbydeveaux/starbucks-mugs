  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in the two metadata files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json). HEAD contained resolution metadata from a prior merge attempt on this branch describing 6 fileguard source-file conflicts (auth middleware, tenant schema, config, dependencies); origin/main contained resolution metadata from a different branch's merge describing 2 metadata-file conflicts for PR #154 (feature/129-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-1-issue-129). Wrote fresh metadata reflecting the actual current merge state for PR #149: only the 2 metadata files were conflicted, all other changes (new DB migrations, storage models, postgres implementation, docs) were already staged cleanly.",
  "strategyUsed": "wrote fresh metadata capturing the actual current merge state; preserved PR #149 and branch identity (feature/138-fileguard-sprint-1-issue-138) as correct for this merge; discarded both sides' stale resolution summaries which described different branches' conflicts"
