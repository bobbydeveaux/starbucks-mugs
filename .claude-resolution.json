  "summary": "Resolved conflict in internal/server/grpc/alert_service.go. The conflict was between HEAD adding an unused hostIDFromHostname placeholder function and using *websocket.Broadcaster for the compile-time interface check, vs origin/main using *websocket.InProcessBroadcaster (a type that does not exist in the codebase). Kept HEAD's correct type (*websocket.Broadcaster) and dropped the dead hostIDFromHostname placeholder.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose HEAD's compile-time assertion (*websocket.Broadcaster, the actual type defined in the codebase) over origin/main's reference to a non-existent type (*websocket.InProcessBroadcaster); dropped HEAD's unused hostIDFromHostname placeholder function as it was dead code not called anywhere"
