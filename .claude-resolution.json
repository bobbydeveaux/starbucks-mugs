  "summary": "Resolved 6 conflicted files from a merge of origin/main into the feature/124 SQLite alert queue branch. The conflicts arose because both branches independently added the internal/queue package (AA conflicts) and both modified go.mod and go.sum. Resolved by: (1) deleting .claude-output.json which origin/main removed; (2) merging go.mod dependency sets to include both HEAD's sqlite deps and origin/main's google/grpc deps; (3) merging go.sum entries keeping HEAD's large block and adopting origin/main's gopkg.in/check.v1 hash; (4) choosing origin/main's design for schema.sql, sqlite_queue.go, and sqlite_queue_test.go as it had a cleaner API (batch Ack, atomic depth counter, PendingEvent type, New constructor).",
  "strategyUsed": "For AA (both-added) conflicts in internal/queue/*, chose origin/main's version as it was more refined: uses atomic.Int64 depth counter (non-blocking), batch Ack([]int64) for efficiency, PendingEvent type, and New() constructor. For go.mod, merged both dependency sets (kept HEAD's sqlite deps, added origin/main's google/grpc/protobuf/fileutil deps). For go.sum, kept HEAD's large block of new entries and adopted origin/main's hash for the gopkg.in/check.v1 checksum conflict. Deleted .claude-output.json as origin/main had removed it."
