  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in getNutritionRows.ts, getNutritionRows.test.ts, and docs/components.md. The core semantic conflict was the parameter order of getNutritionRows: HEAD used (costaDrink, starbucksDrink) while main used (starbucksDrink, costaDrink). ComparisonPanel.tsx calls the function as getNutritionRows(starbucksDrink, costaDrink), so main's parameter order is correct. NutritionRow is already defined in types.ts so the inline redefinition from main was dropped in favour of importing from types. Tests were merged from both sides preserving all unique test cases. For docs/components.md, HEAD added only a brief getNutritionRows stub while main added FilterBar, SearchBox, ComparisonPanel, NutritionRow utility, and NutritionBar sections; all of main's content was kept as the superset.",
  "strategyUsed": "For getNutritionRows.ts: chose main's parameter order (starbucks first) because ComparisonPanel.tsx uses that order, but kept HEAD's approach of importing NutritionRow from types.ts rather than redefining it inline. For getNutritionRows.test.ts: merged both test suites using main's parameter order throughout, combining HEAD's property-shape test with main's zero-values test. For docs/components.md: kept main's much larger documentation block (FilterBar, SearchBox, ComparisonPanel, NutritionRow utility, NutritionBar) as it is a superset of HEAD's stub, with main's correct starbucks-first parameter order in the getNutritionRows signature."
