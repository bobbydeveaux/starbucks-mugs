  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicts in metadata files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json). These files contained summaries of prior resolution sessions: one session resolved 3 conflicts (.claude-output.json deletion accepted, fileguard/core/__init__.py docstring adopted from origin/main, fileguard/core/av_adapter.py async interface adopted from origin/main); another session resolved conflicts in cmd/agent/main.go, internal/config/config.go, and agent-core.md (adopting origin/main's unconditional NetworkWatcher creation, variable naming, and protocol defaults) and fileguard/core/__init__.py (merging module docstring descriptions). Both prior resolution histories are preserved in this combined summary.",
  "strategyUsed": "Merged the two conflicting resolution summaries into a single combined description that preserves both prior sessions' history. For .conflict-info.json: no conflict markers were present, staged as-is. Chose to combine filesResolved count to reflect only the current session's 2 metadata file resolutions."
