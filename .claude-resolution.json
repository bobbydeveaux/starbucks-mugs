  "summary": "Resolved conflict in docs/components.md by preserving documentation from both branches. HEAD added Ferrari vs Lamborghini components (SearchBar, EraFilter, CatalogFilters, useCarCatalog hook); origin/main added Costa vs Starbucks components (FilterBar, SearchBox, ComparisonPanel, NutritionRow utility, NutritionBar). All sections were non-overlapping so both sets were kept.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes — Costa/Starbucks component docs from origin/main (FilterBar, SearchBox, ComparisonPanel, NutritionRow, NutritionBar) placed first, followed by Ferrari/Lamborghini component docs from HEAD (SearchBar, EraFilter, CatalogFilters, useCarCatalog), then shared TypeScript Types section"
