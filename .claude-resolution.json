  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in src/utils/getNutritionRows.ts and src/utils/getNutritionRows.test.ts by keeping the HEAD (feature branch) version, which is a superset of the origin/main version with null-safe drink parameters, maxValue for bar scaling, ariaLabel for WCAG accessibility, and a key field per nutrition row.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose HEAD for both files — the feature branch implementation adds null handling (Drink | null params), maxValue computation, WCAG-compliant ariaLabel generation, and a structured NUTRITION_METRICS array, all of which are strictly more capable than the simpler origin/main version; the comprehensive HEAD test suite was preserved to match the richer implementation"
