  "summary": "Resolved 1 conflicted file: docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/file-watcher.md. The conflict arose because HEAD described two watcher implementations (FileWatcher + InotifyWatcher) while origin/main described three (adding KqueueWatcher for macOS). The resolution merges both sides, keeping the origin/main introduction table with all three implementations, retaining the InotifyWatcher deep-dive section from HEAD (inotify internals, event masks, how-it-works), and adopting origin/main's expanded API docs for InotifyWatcher and KqueueWatcher, the extended event-types table (including the 'access' event), the tri-platform wiring examples, the SLA validation section, and the updated test coverage tables (including the new KqueueWatcher test table and corrected file name file_watcher_linux_test.go).",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes — kept all unique content from both sides, resolving structural/organizational differences by adopting origin/main's document structure (which is a superset) while retaining HEAD's detailed InotifyWatcher internals section that was not duplicated in origin/main."
