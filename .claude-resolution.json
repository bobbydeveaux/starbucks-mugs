  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in 3 files: grpc-alert-service.md (documentation phrasing), alert_service.go (Store interface comment, HostID candidate variable, compile-time interface check), and alert_service_test.go (mockStore.UpsertHost returnHostID logic). All conflicts were between slightly different phrasings/implementations of the same stable host_id feature. The critical resolution was the compile-time interface check: chose origin/main's *websocket.Broadcaster (the correct type that exists in the package) over HEAD's *websocket.InProcessBroadcaster (which does not exist). For alert_service_test.go, kept HEAD's returnHostID field and conditional logic needed by TestRegisterAgent_StableHostID.",
  "strategyUsed": "Mixed: for documentation and Store interface comments, kept HEAD's more detailed phrasing; for the HostID struct field, kept HEAD's use of the pre-declared candidateID variable (cleaner than origin/main's inline uuid.NewString()); for the compile-time interface check, chose origin/main's *websocket.Broadcaster (the actual type defined in the package) over HEAD's *websocket.InProcessBroadcaster (non-existent type that would cause compile failure); for the test mock, kept HEAD's full returnHostID conditional logic required by the TestRegisterAgent_StableHostID test case"
