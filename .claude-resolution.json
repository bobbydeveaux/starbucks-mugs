  "summary": "Resolved 4 'both added' conflicts: alembic.ini (merged richer main config with HEAD header/prepend_sys_path/black-hint), fileguard/__init__.py (merged comment style — em-dash from main, capitalisation from HEAD), migrations/env.py (kept HEAD's complete autogenerate setup with Base.metadata and compare_type/compare_server_default, adopted main's docstring for run_async_migrations), requirements.txt (merged all packages from both sides — HEAD's higher version pins, main's categorised layout, added missing auth/cloud/observability packages).",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes — took the more complete/correct version from each side and merged additive differences; HEAD's functional choices were preferred for env.py (ORM autogenerate); main's richer config options were kept for alembic.ini; requirements.txt combined all unique packages from both branches using HEAD's higher minimum version constraints"
