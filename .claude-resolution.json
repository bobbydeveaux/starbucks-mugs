  "summary": "Resolved 6 conflict regions in style.css and 2 in index.html. Preferred origin/main's more polished UI changes while preserving HEAD's accessibility attribute (outline-offset: 2px on focus-visible).",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main for: expanded CSP policy (img-src 'self' data:), improved page title/subtitle, autocomplete='off' on search input, comment in grid div, ID-specific CSS selectors for #search and #filter-series, year input spinner removal (-moz-appearance/webkit), outlined reset button style, richer .grid-empty with sub-element selectors and image placeholder styles, and consolidated responsive media query. Retained outline-offset: 2px from HEAD on #filter-reset:focus-visible for accessibility."
