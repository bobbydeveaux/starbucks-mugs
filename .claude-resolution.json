  "summary": "Resolved conflict in .claude-output.json by adopting the origin/main version, which contains the gRPC server task metadata. The origin/main version is consistent with the new files being merged in (cmd/server/main.go, internal/server/grpc/server.go, proto/alert.pb.go, etc.). The HEAD version contained eBPF process watcher metadata which belongs to a prior task already completed on this branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for .claude-output.json — its metadata (gRPC server bootstrap with mTLS) corresponds to the new files being incorporated from origin/main into this branch; the HEAD version described the eBPF process watcher task which was already merged previously"
