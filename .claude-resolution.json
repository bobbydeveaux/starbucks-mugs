  "summary": "Resolved 1 conflict in docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/agent-core.md. The conflict was in the 'Package: internal/watcher' section: HEAD documented the listener-based NetworkWatcher (internal/watcher/network_watcher.go) while origin/main documented the FileWatcher with a pointer to file-watcher.md. Both components exist in the package, so both were preserved.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes: kept origin/main's FileWatcher description and file-watcher.md reference, then appended HEAD's NetworkWatcher documentation (types, constructor, lifecycle, event channel) since both implementations coexist in internal/watcher."
