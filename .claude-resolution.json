  "summary": "Resolved conflict in .claude-output.json by keeping the HEAD (feature branch) version, which contains the correct PR metadata for PR #275 (Prometheus metrics for transport layer). The origin/main version contained metadata for a different PR (protobuf schema, Closes #224) and was not relevant to this branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose ours (HEAD) — the conflicted file is PR metadata and the HEAD version correctly describes this branch's PR #275 changes; the main branch version described an unrelated PR"
