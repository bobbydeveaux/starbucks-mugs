  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in useComparison.ts, useComparison.test.ts, eraMatchSuggestion.ts, and eraMatchSuggestion.test.ts. Both branches independently added these files with differing implementations and test suites. Chose origin/main's versions as the canonical implementation due to better JSDoc, cleaner function naming (winnerFor with lowerIsBetter param), more efficient Map-based lookup in eraMatchSuggestion, and more comprehensive test suites organized with describe blocks. Fixed imageUrl→image field name in test fixtures to match the CarModel type definition. Updated ComparePage.tsx to alias stats as winners to maintain compatibility with ComparisonView's prop API.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main for all four files as the superior implementation (better named API, more efficient algorithms, more comprehensive tests). Fixed a type mismatch (imageUrl→image) in test fixtures that origin/main introduced. Updated ComparePage.tsx destructuring to bridge the renamed stats field to the existing winners prop on ComparisonView."
