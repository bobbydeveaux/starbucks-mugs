  "summary": "Resolved 2 metadata-only conflicts in .claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json. Both conflicts arose from prior AI-assisted merge resolution metadata written independently on feature/173-fileguard-sprint-2-issue-173 and origin/main. No source code conflicts were present. .conflict-info.json had no conflict markers and was staged as-is. .claude-resolution.json conflict was resolved by writing fresh metadata describing the current resolution.",
  "strategyUsed": "Wrote fresh resolution metadata reflecting the current merge state (PR #193, 2 conflicted metadata files). The HEAD version described resolving audit.py source conflicts (filesResolved=2); origin/main described resolving 3 metadata conflicts from a prior merge. Since both were stale descriptions of earlier resolutions, a new accurate summary was authored rather than choosing either side."
