  "summary": "Resolved 10 conflicted files between feature/40-costa-vs-starbucks-sprint-1-issue-40 and origin/main. HEAD was an initial scaffold with brand tokens and placeholder UI; main had the advanced DrinkCatalog component, vitest setup, and updated dependencies.",
  "strategyUsed": "Merged both sides where possible: .gitignore combines .env files (ours) with .vite/ and *.tsbuildinfo (theirs); package.json merges all scripts and uses main's newer dependency versions plus testing libraries; App.tsx uses main's DrinkCatalog implementation (placeholder replaced by real feature); index.css keeps HEAD's brand CSS custom properties and utility classes; main.tsx keeps HEAD's safer null-check over non-null assertion; tailwind.config.ts uses main's module structure with merged color tokens from both (dark from HEAD, accent from main); tsconfig.json uses main's modern Vite 5 two-reference structure; tsconfig.node.json uses main's stricter settings; vite.config.ts merges HEAD's @/ path alias with main's vitest test config; package-lock.json taken from main to match main's dependency versions."
