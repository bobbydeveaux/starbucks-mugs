  "summary": "Resolved conflict in .claude-output.json. Kept HEAD's version which accurately describes this branch's PR (#270): WebSocket handler and gRPC service review feedback fixes (closes #228). The origin/main version described a different PR (GitHub Actions build matrix, closes #231) which is unrelated to this feature branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose HEAD for all conflict sections: HEAD's prTitle, prBody, and filesChanged accurately reflect this branch's work (WebSocket/gRPC fixes). HEAD's docsReviewed (grpc-alert-service.md, LLD.md, README.md) and completedTasks [1,2,3,4,5] are retained. origin/main's conflicting sections described a separate PR's artifacts and were discarded to avoid mixing unrelated PR metadata."
