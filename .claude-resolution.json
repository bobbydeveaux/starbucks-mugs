  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicted metadata files for PR #214 (feature/124-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-2-issue-124). The .claude-resolution.json file contained conflict markers between two stale prior-session AI summaries: HEAD described a 6-file SQLite alert queue merge; origin/main described a 2-file metadata merge. The .conflict-info.json file had no conflict markers and already contained the correct current-session metadata.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-resolution.json: wrote a fresh resolution summary for the current session rather than merging two stale prior-session descriptions that no longer apply. For .conflict-info.json: the file contained no conflict markers and already had correct content (PR #214, feature/124 branch), so it was staged as-is."
