  "summary": "Resolved 2 metadata-only conflicts in .claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json for PR #207. The actual source code changes (fileguard/core/__init__.py, fileguard/core/document_extractor.py, tests/unit/test_document_extractor.py, docs/concepts/fileguard/README.md) were already staged without conflicts. HEAD contained stale file-watcher resolution metadata from a prior run on this branch; origin/main contained stale DocumentExtractor metadata from PR #201 on a different branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-resolution.json: authored a fresh accurate summary since both sides contained stale descriptions from earlier resolutions on different branches/PRs. For .conflict-info.json: accepted HEAD version since it correctly reflects PR #207 on feature/119-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-2-issue-119, whereas origin/main contained info about PR #201 on a different branch."
