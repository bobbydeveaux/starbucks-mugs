  "summary": "Resolved 1 conflict in fileguard/core/__init__.py: merged two different module-level descriptions into a single docstring that captures the intent of both sides.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes: HEAD used a proper Python module docstring ('Core scan engine components for FileGuard.') and origin/main used a comment ('fileguard.core — pipeline components'). Combined them into a single docstring that covers both descriptions, preferring the docstring form as the more Pythonic and tooling-friendly approach."
