  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in app.js, index.html, mugs.json, and style.css. The feature branch (HEAD) had a polished implementation with CSS variables, animations, responsive breakpoints, accessible overlay using detail-* element IDs, and real Unsplash images. origin/main had a simpler baseline using modal-* element IDs, placeholder images, and an ES module export. Since the two naming schemes were incompatible, HEAD's implementation was used as the primary. Improvements from origin/main (DocumentFragment optimization in renderGrid, export statement in app.js) were incorporated.",
  "strategyUsed": "Used HEAD's implementation as the base for all files (more complete design with CSS variables, accessibility, animations, footer, responsive breakpoints). Incorporated origin/main's DocumentFragment optimization in renderGrid and ES module export in app.js. mugs.json used HEAD's version with real Unsplash images and richer descriptions."
