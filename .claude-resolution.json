  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in 4 files: process_watcher.go (package comment only), process_watcher_darwin.go (full file — both branches added it), process_watcher_other.go (comment and implementation), and process-watcher.md (two conflict regions). The feature branch (HEAD) implemented Darwin support using an old per-platform Start/Stop method pattern directly on ProcessWatcher, while origin/main refactored to a processBackend interface pattern. The origin/main architecture was chosen for all Go files to avoid duplicate method compilation errors. The markdown documentation was merged to preserve detailed technical content from both branches.",
  "strategyUsed": "For Go source files (process_watcher.go, process_watcher_darwin.go, process_watcher_other.go): chose origin/main's processBackend interface architecture throughout, as HEAD's per-platform Start/Stop methods would cause duplicate method compilation errors with process_watcher.go which already defines those methods. For process_watcher.go package comment: chose origin/main's version (correct eBPF file path internal/watcher/ebpf/process.bpf.c, accurate Other platform description as ps polling not error stub). For process-watcher.md: merged both sides — used origin/main's more detailed overview table and Choosing a runtime comparison section; kept HEAD's detailed Darwin kqueue architecture documentation (how it works diagram, privilege requirements, known limitations) and added origin/main's Running the tests and Test coverage sections."
