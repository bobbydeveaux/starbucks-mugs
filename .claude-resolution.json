  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in middleware.go and middleware_test.go by adopting the origin/main implementation, which is a more complete, production-ready RS256 JWT middleware. The HEAD branch had a simpler implementation using the github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5 library, while origin/main implemented RS256 verification from scratch with richer features including JWTConfig struct, ParseRSAPublicKey helper, SkipPaths support, issuer/audience claim validation, and structured logging. The test file was updated correspondingly to use the external test package (rest_test) and the new JWTConfig-based API, along with more comprehensive test cases.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for both files: the main branch contained a significantly more feature-complete implementation (self-contained RS256 without external JWT library, configurable middleware, PEM key parsing, skip paths, issuer/audience validation, logging) that superseded the simpler HEAD implementation; tests were updated to match the new API and cover additional scenarios"
