The HEAD version of .claude-resolution.json documented resolution of 4 Python files (fileguard/core/__init__.py, fileguard/core/document_extractor.py, tests/unit/test_document_extractor.py, and .claude-output.json deletion). The origin/main version documented resolution of 1 docs conflict (docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/agent-core.md). Both summaries were merged to preserve full resolution history.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-resolution.json: merged both prior resolution summaries into a single unified record preserving the full history of resolved conflicts across branches. For .conflict-info.json: kept the working-tree version which accurately reflects the current merge's conflicted files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json, conflictCount: 2), as this was the most current and accurate representation of the actual conflict state."
