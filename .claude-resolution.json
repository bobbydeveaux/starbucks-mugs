  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in package.json, package-lock.json, src/types.ts, and tsconfig.json by merging feature branch testing infrastructure with main branch's dependency updates and improved type documentation.",
  "strategyUsed": "package.json: merged both sides - kept testing libraries (@testing-library/*, jsdom) and scripts (test:watch, test:legacy) from HEAD, used newer dependency versions from main, and added typecheck script from main. package-lock.json: chose HEAD (ours) since it contains the complete package set including testing library dependencies missing from main. src/types.ts: chose main (theirs) as it has identical type definitions but with superior JSDoc documentation and consistent semicolons. tsconfig.json: chose HEAD (ours) as the composite project references structure is correct given tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.node.json both exist in the project."
