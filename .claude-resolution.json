  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicts in metadata files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json). Both files were modified independently in two previous resolution sessions: one session resolved 4 conflicts across cmd/agent/main.go, internal/config/config.go, and agent-core.md (adopting origin/main's unconditional NetworkWatcher creation, variable naming, and protocol defaults); another session resolved 1 conflict in fileguard/core/__init__.py (merging module docstring descriptions). The .conflict-info.json had no conflict markers and was staged as-is.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both prior resolution summaries by merging them into a combined description; chose the current branch's .conflict-info.json content (no markers present) as the authoritative state for conflict metadata."
