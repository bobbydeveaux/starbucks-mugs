  "summary": "Resolved conflict in deployments/launchd/com.tripwire.agent.plist. Merged both versions: kept the comprehensive installation/usage header comment and additional features from origin/main (EnvironmentVariables, resource limits/fd caps, sandboxing note, 'start --config' command syntax), while preserving HEAD's more deliberate KeepAlive behavior (Crashed:true — restart only on non-zero exit, mirroring systemd Restart=on-failure), ProcessType:Background, and 5s ThrottleInterval (matching the stated acceptance criterion).",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes: adopted origin/main's richer documentation header, command syntax (start --config), EnvironmentVariables section, and resource limits; retained HEAD's KeepAlive:{Crashed:true} (more intentional crash-only restart semantics), ProcessType:Background, and 5s ThrottleInterval (acceptance-criterion value)."
