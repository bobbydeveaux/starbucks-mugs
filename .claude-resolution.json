  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicts for PR #207: (1) internal/watcher/file_watcher_linux.go — both branches added different inotify implementations; chose origin/main's startPlatformWatcher function which is architecturally consistent with the FileWatcher/platformWatcherFunc pattern used in file_watcher.go and file_watcher_other.go. (2) .claude-output.json — deleted by our branch, present in origin/main; accepted our deletion as it is a transient CI artifact.",
  "strategyUsed": "For file_watcher_linux.go: our branch implemented an InotifyWatcher struct (incompatible with the platformWatcherFunc interface expected by FileWatcher), while origin/main implemented the matching startPlatformWatcher function. Chose theirs to maintain architectural consistency. For .claude-output.json: accepted our deletion since it is a generated metadata artifact not required by the codebase."
