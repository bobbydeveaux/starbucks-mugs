  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in .claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json. Both files are CI/CD workflow metadata generated per-branch. .conflict-info.json was already resolved in the working tree (correct PR #291 and branch context). .claude-resolution.json had a conflict between two previous AI-written summaries about a prior .claude-output.json resolution; replaced with current resolution metadata.",
  "strategyUsed": "replaced both conflicted metadata files with correct current-context values — .conflict-info.json already had no markers and was staged as-is; .claude-resolution.json conflict markers were removed and the file was rewritten to reflect this resolution session rather than carrying forward stale summaries from prior merge runs"
