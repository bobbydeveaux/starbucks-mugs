  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicted files: used origin/main's loadMugs() implementation (handles both legacy bare-array and versioned envelope formats), updated integration test to match, preserved HEAD's rich 52-entry mugs.json schema, and kept origin/main's review feedback as the most accurate review.",
  "strategyUsed": "For app.js: chose origin/main's loadMugs() which returns { version, mugs } consistently (compatible with bootstrap destructuring .then(({ mugs }) => renderCards(mugs))). For app.test.js: chose origin/main's test_fetchSuccess to match the resolved loadMugs() behavior. For mugs.json: chose HEAD's version which is a superset (52 entries with rich schema including series/year/region/material/capacity_oz/tags fields vs origin/main's 6 minimal entries). For .review-feedback.txt: chose origin/main's review which accurately reflects the current state of the PR. All 23 tests pass."
