  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicted files: docs/concepts/fileguard/README.md, fileguard/core/__init__.py, fileguard/core/document_extractor.py, and tests/unit/test_document_extractor.py. The core conflict was a fundamental API design divergence between the feature branch (synchronous extract(data, filename) with auto-MIME detection, ByteOffset NamedTuple, granular UnsupportedMIMETypeError/CorruptFileError exceptions) and origin/main (async extract(content, mime_type), OffsetEntry dataclass, unified ExtractionError, _normalize/_collect_strings/_guess_mime_from_name helpers, Latin-1 fallback for text). Origin/main's implementation was chosen as the authoritative version since it is better suited for FastAPI's async runtime and provides richer text normalization.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main for all conflicts: (1) __init__.py: replaced comment with proper Python module docstring; (2) README.md: used origin/main's complete project structure (includes rate_limit.py), full test directory layout with integration tests, async API usage example, and AuditService documentation; (3) document_extractor.py: adopted origin/main's async interface (await extract(content, mime_type)), OffsetEntry dataclass, single ExtractionError, and private helpers (_normalize, _collect_strings, _guess_mime_from_name) with Latin-1 text fallback and better JSON string extraction; (4) test_document_extractor.py: used origin/main's test suite which tests the async API via mocked run_in_executor and exercises all private _extract_* methods directly."
