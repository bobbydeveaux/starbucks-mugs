  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in .claude-output.json and docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/file-watcher.md. For the JSON metadata, kept HEAD's PR title/body/filesChanged (file watcher branch identity) while merging in origin/main's extended docsReviewed list (ROAM, agent-configuration.md, storage.md) and preserving HEAD's completedTasks field. For the markdown doc, used origin/main's version as the base since it accurately describes the actual polling-based implementation (100ms interval, slice-of-rules constructor, Ready() method, path+operation detail fields), while incorporating the extended Configuration YAML examples from HEAD.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-output.json: preserved HEAD's PR-specific identity fields (prTitle, prBody, filesChanged) for the file-watcher branch, merged docsUpdated to include both file-watcher.md and agent-core.md, used the superset docsReviewed list from origin/main, and retained HEAD's completedTasks. For file-watcher.md: chose origin/main's version as the canonical base because it matches the actual file.go implementation (polling, NewFileWatcher([]TripwireRule, *slog.Logger, time.Duration), Ready() channel, detail fields path+operation only); merged HEAD's additional YAML rule examples into the Configuration section."
