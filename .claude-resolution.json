  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in fileguard/core/patterns/__init__.py and fileguard/core/patterns/uk_patterns.py. Both files had divergent implementations of the UK PII pattern library. The origin/main version defines the API (PatternDefinition, BUILTIN_PATTERNS, get_patterns, load_custom_patterns) that is already used by the staged pii_detector.py and test_pii_detector.py files, so the origin/main version was chosen for both files.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for both conflicted files — the origin/main API (PatternDefinition dataclass, BUILTIN_PATTERNS public constant, get_patterns/load_custom_patterns functions, pattern names PHONE/POSTCODE) is the one required by the already-staged pii_detector.py and test_pii_detector.py; the HEAD version used incompatible names (PatternEntry, _BUILTIN_PATTERNS, load_patterns, UK_PHONE, UK_POSTCODE)"
