  "summary": "Resolved two merge conflicts: accepted main's deletion of .claude-output.json (a generated metadata file not intended for the repo), and resolved the pytest command conflict in middleware.md by choosing 'pytest tests/ -v' to run all tests including integration tests, which are fully offline per the documentation.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-output.json: accepted theirs (deletion) since the file is a generated artifact that main correctly removed. For docs/concepts/fileguard/middleware.md: chose origin/main's 'pytest tests/ -v' over HEAD's 'pytest tests/unit/ -v' to preserve full test coverage including integration tests, which the documentation confirms are fully offline (SQLite in-memory, no external services required)."
