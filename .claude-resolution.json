  "summary": "Resolved 3 conflicts: (1) src/hooks/useCarCatalog.ts — chose origin/main's richer implementation with internal debounced search state, setEra/setSearch setters, and separate filteredFerraris/filteredLambos arrays; HEAD's version had an unnecessary image→imageUrl mapping since the actual JSON already uses imageUrl. (2) src/hooks/useCarCatalog.test.ts — chose origin/main's comprehensive test suite covering debounce timing, era filtering, combined filters, and initialFilters support, matching the richer hook API. (3) .claude-output.json — accepted deletion by origin/main as this is a transient task metadata file not needed in the merged branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for both hook files — the origin/main useCarCatalog implementation is a superset of HEAD's: it adds debounced search via useRef/useCallback, internal era/search state with setter functions, and exposes both unfiltered (ferrariCars/lamboCars) and filtered (filteredFerraris/filteredLambos) arrays; it also correctly uses CarCatalogEnvelope from types directly (JSON data already has imageUrl), avoiding the redundant mapRawCar conversion in HEAD; accepted deletion of .claude-output.json as it is a CI metadata artifact not part of the feature"
