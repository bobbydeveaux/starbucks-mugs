  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicts for PR #203. In cmd/agent/main.go, HEAD added a NetworkWatcher for NETWORK-type rules (Protocol/Direction feature) while origin/main added FileWatchers for FILE-type rules via buildFileWatchers(). Both watchers handle different rule types and were preserved together. The .claude-output.json file was deleted by origin/main and that deletion was accepted.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes: kept the NetworkWatcher instantiation from HEAD and added the FileWatcher registration from origin/main, using the shared agentOpts slice so both watcher types are registered with the agent. Accepted origin/main's deletion of .claude-output.json as it is a generated artifact not needed in the repo."
