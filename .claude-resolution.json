  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicted metadata files for PR #202 (feature/118-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-2-issue-118). Both .claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json contained conflict markers between stale prior-session AI summaries that no longer applied to the current merge. The actual merge changes (fileguard AV engine adapter: __init__.py, base.py, clamav.py, test_av_engine.py, av-engine-adapter.md) were already staged without conflicts.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-resolution.json: wrote a fresh resolution summary for the current session rather than merging two stale prior-session descriptions that no longer apply. For .conflict-info.json: the file already had correct current-session metadata (PR #202, feature/118 branch) without conflict markers, so it was staged as-is."
