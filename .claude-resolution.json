  "summary": "Resolved conflict in docs/concepts/fileguard/README.md. The conflict was in the project structure tree: HEAD referenced report.py/reports.py (Celery-based) while origin/main referenced compliance_report.py (read-only service). Both sets of files exist in the repo, so both were preserved in the merged result.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes — kept all file references from both branches (schemas/report.py + schemas/compliance_report.py, services/reports.py + services/compliance_report.py, celery_app.py, test_report_service.py + test_compliance_report_api.py) since all files genuinely exist in the working tree"
