  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts between feature/44-costa-vs-starbucks-sprint-1-issue-44 (useDrinks hook implementation) and origin/main (code review fixes). Removed node_modules from git tracking (gitignored). For source files, preserved the most complete and functional version from each side, merging improvements where both sides contributed value.",
  "strategyUsed": "node_modules: removed from git index (correctly gitignored on both branches); .claude-output.json: kept ours (feature branch PR metadata); package.json: merged both — union of all dependencies using newer versions from HEAD, added recharts/eslint-plugins/tailwindcss from main, kept type:module and extra scripts from main; package-lock.json: kept ours; data files (starbucks.json, costa.json): kept ours (more comprehensive — 31 drinks per brand with image paths); src/types.ts: merged — used main's better JSDoc/section structure while keeping DrinkNutrition interface name, made image optional to support both data formats; src/hooks/useDrinks.ts: kept HEAD's more complete interface exposing starbucksDrinks and costaDrinks separately, with AbortController cleanup pattern; tsconfig.json: merged — kept noFallthroughCasesInSwitch from HEAD, added main's @/* path alias and project references; vite.config.ts: merged — kept vitest triple-slash reference and @/* alias from main, merged test config keeping jsdom/globals from HEAD plus css:false and broader include pattern from main"
