  "summary": "Resolved 7 conflicts across proto definition, gRPC server infrastructure, WebSocket broadcaster, test files, documentation, go.mod, and code review feedback. The core conflict was two different architectural approaches: HEAD implemented AlertService RPCs directly in server.go while origin/main added mTLS server infrastructure in server.go and a separate alert_service.go. The resolution uses origin/main's mTLS server infrastructure (Config, TLS credential loading, CN interceptors) as server.go, preserves HEAD's AlertService implementation in alert_service.go, and uses origin/main's InProcessBroadcaster (Subscribe/Publish/Close API) which is what alert_service.go and its tests require. Import paths are harmonized to use proto/alert package throughout. The go.mod merges direct dependencies from both branches (chi, jwt from main; uuid, pgx from HEAD). Both code review feedback sections are preserved.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for gRPC server infrastructure (mTLS Config/Server/interceptors in server.go), chose origin/main for InProcessBroadcaster (Subscribe/Publish/Close API matching alert_service.go), chose origin/main for proto package definition (package alert, go_package=proto/alert matching existing generated stubs and alert_service.go imports), updated server_test.go to use proto/alert types (RegisterRequest/RegisterResponse instead of AgentRegistration/ServerAck), merged go.mod direct deps from both branches, merged documentation and code review feedback from both branches"
