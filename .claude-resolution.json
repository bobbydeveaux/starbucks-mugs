  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicted metadata files for PR #195 (feature/166-fileguard-sprint-2-issue-166). Both .claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json contained conflict markers between stale prior-session AI summaries that no longer applied to the current merge. The actual merge changes (agent.go, file.go, watcher.go, agent-core.md, file-watcher.md) were already staged without conflicts.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-resolution.json: wrote a fresh resolution summary for the current session rather than merging two stale prior-session descriptions from different PRs that no longer apply. For .conflict-info.json: the file already had correct current-session metadata (PR #195, feature/166 branch) without conflict markers, so it was staged as-is."
