  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in .claude-output.json, index.html, and style.css. Kept HEAD PR metadata for .claude-output.json (filter bar PR #24). Merged HTML by preserving origin/main's CSP meta tag, accessibility improvements (autocomplete='off', aria-label on grid), and using year-range-label class consistently. Merged CSS by taking origin/main's polished filter-bar styles (per-element focus states, hidden spinners, green reset button) while adding min-height to results-count from HEAD to prevent layout shift.",
