  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicts from merging origin/main into feature/164-fileguard-sprint-2-issue-164 (PR #208). Three 'both added' file conflicts were resolved by keeping the HEAD (feature branch) versions: fileguard/core/__init__.py, fileguard/core/document_extractor.py, and tests/unit/test_document_extractor.py. The .claude-output.json deletion (deleted by us in HEAD, present in origin/main) was resolved by staging the deletion.",
  "strategyUsed": "For the three 'both added' Python files: chose HEAD (feature branch) versions over origin/main versions. The HEAD implementation of DocumentExtractor uses module-level functions (_extract_txt, _extract_json, _extract_csv, _extract_pdf, _extract_docx, _extract_zip, _dispatch_sync, _guess_mime) with ExtractionResult.byte_offsets: list[int], plus ZIP safety limits (size, count, depth). The origin/main version used a different OffsetEntry dataclass approach with class methods. The HEAD tests are comprehensive and match the HEAD implementation API. For .claude-output.json: kept our deletion since the file is a CI artifact not needed on this branch."
