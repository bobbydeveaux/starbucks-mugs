  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in index.html, mugs.json, and style.css. app.js (not conflicted) clearly targets HEAD's patterns (modal.hidden, .modal-backdrop, id=modal-image, .grid-error, .card-image), so HEAD was used as the base for all three files. Safe, non-breaking improvements from origin/main were incorporated: self-closing void tags and aria-live attribute in HTML; section comments, separate :focus-visible rule, modal-close focus styles, and modal-name padding-right in CSS. mugs.json used HEAD's version because app.test.js fixtures exactly match HEAD's mug names and prices.",
  "strategyUsed": "Used HEAD as base for all files (app.js and app.test.js both depend on HEAD's structure and data); cherry-picked non-breaking accessibility and style improvements from origin/main where they did not conflict with app.js API surface"
