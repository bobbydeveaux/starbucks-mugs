  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicts between the NetworkWatcher feature branch and main. The main branch contained a more complete NetworkWatcher implementation (supporting tcp6, returning errors on invalid ports, cleaner ConnKey/ProcReader API, proper lifecycle with done channel). Kept the main branch's implementation for network_watcher.go and its tests, used main's NetworkWatcher documentation for agent-core.md, and kept the HEAD branch's .claude-output.json metadata (appropriate for the NetworkWatcher PR on this branch).",
  "strategyUsed": "For network_watcher.go and network_watcher_test.go: chose main's implementation entirely, as it is more complete (tcp6 support, error-returning constructor, cleaner ProcReader function type, events channel closed on stop) and the test suite is aligned with it. For agent-core.md: chose main's NetworkWatcher section to match the actual code implementation. For .claude-output.json: kept HEAD (our branch's NetworkWatcher PR metadata), since this file records work done by the current feature branch."
