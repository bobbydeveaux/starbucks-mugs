  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in docs/concepts/fileguard/README.md (3 conflict regions) and fileguard/schemas/report.py (3 conflict regions). For the README, chose origin/main in all regions: it correctly reflects the actual file structure (routes/ vs handlers/), includes the compliance_report.py and celery_app.py files that exist, and provides Celery quick-start content that complements the detailed API docs already present lower in the document. For report.py, chose origin/main to preserve the richer report-generation schemas (VerdictBreakdown, ReportPayload, ComplianceReportCreate, ComplianceReportRead); the HEAD-only ReportSummary/ReportListResponse schemas were superseded by fileguard/schemas/compliance_report.py (ComplianceReportOut/ComplianceReportListResponse) which the routes already import.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for all conflicts: routes/ directory structure matches actual files; compliance_report.py and celery_app.py genuinely exist; report.py richer generation schemas are used by services while API response schemas live in compliance_report.py"
