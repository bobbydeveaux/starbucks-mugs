  "strategyUsed": "Used origin/main as primary for all five files: (1) docs/components.md — discarded HEAD's duplicate/old-API sections for CarCard, CatalogPage, and single-brand useCarCatalog; kept origin/main's new filter component docs (expanded dual-brand useCarCatalog API, EraFilter, SearchBar, CatalogFilters); (2) CarCard.tsx — used origin/main's structure (decade badge, engine config in specs row, 'Top Speed:' label, '✓ Selected' button text, correct alt/aria-label format) while adding focus ring color classes from HEAD for accessibility; (3) CarCard.test.tsx — used origin/main's more comprehensive test suite (15 tests) with decade badge, dual-brand fixtures, and '✓ Selected' assertion consistent with the component; (4) useCarCatalog.ts — used origin/main's dual-brand implementation (fetches both ferrari.json and lamborghini.json in parallel, exposes filteredFerraris/filteredLambos with debounced search and era filter) which is consistent with CatalogPage.tsx already in the codebase; (5) useCarCatalog.test.ts — used origin/main's comprehensive test suite covering parallel fetch, debounced search timing, era filtering, combined filters, initialFilters, and per-brand error handling"
