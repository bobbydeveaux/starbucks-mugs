  "summary": "Resolved two conflict sections in agent/README.md. First conflict: dropped the redundant macOS arm64 cross-compile example from HEAD (already covered in the cross-compile table above it) and kept origin/main's additions: version-string embedding example and the CI/CD GitHub Actions section. Second conflict: merged sprint status tables by keeping HEAD's accurate implemented-feature rows (Sprint 1-4 features) and adding origin/main's new GitHub Actions build matrix entry.",
