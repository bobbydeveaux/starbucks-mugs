  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicts across 3 Go source files and 1 documentation file. The Go conflicts involved two fundamentally different architectural approaches to the ProcessWatcher: HEAD used a processBackend interface with /proc polling on Linux, while origin/main used a NETLINK_CONNECTOR implementation with direct Start/Stop methods on the watcher struct. The resolution keeps HEAD's processBackend architecture (required by process_watcher_darwin.go and the internal test suite) while adopting origin/main's superior NETLINK_CONNECTOR implementation for Linux as a processBackend. A new optional backendStarter interface was introduced to allow the Linux backend to surface privilege errors through Start(), satisfying the unprivileged error path test from origin/main. The matchProcessName function was enhanced with empty-target wildcard and glob pattern support from origin/main. Documentation was merged from both branches.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both: kept HEAD's processBackend interface architecture (compatible with darwin backend and existing internal tests), adopted main's NETLINK_CONNECTOR Linux implementation adapted as a processBackend + backendStarter, added optional backendStarter interface so Linux backend can surface CAP_NET_ADMIN errors from Start(), enhanced matchProcessName with empty wildcard and glob support, merged documentation comprehensively from both branches"
