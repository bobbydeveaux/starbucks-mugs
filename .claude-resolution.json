  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicted files: accepted our deletion of .claude-output.json; resolved ebpf/process.go and ebpf/process_test.go by choosing origin/main's Loader API (consistent with the already-staged process_stub.go for non-Linux); merged process-watcher.md by combining origin/main's multi-platform backend table (including the new macOS backend) with HEAD's detailed Go eBPF Loader section updated for the Loader API. Also fixed bpfobject_embed_linux.go to remove a stale reference to bpfObjectBytes which no longer exists after choosing origin/main's process.go.",
  "strategyUsed": "For process.go: chose origin/main (cilium/ebpf Loader API) over HEAD (custom ProcessWatcher) because process_stub.go was already staged defining the same Loader/ExecEvent/ErrNotSupported API for non-Linux — consistency required using the Loader pattern on Linux too. For process_test.go: chose origin/main's internal package tests (testing parseExecEvent, cString, requireKernelVersion) which match the resolved process.go API. For process-watcher.md: preserved both sides — origin/main's platform table (with new macOS backend) in the Overview, and HEAD's detailed Go eBPF Loader architecture section updated to reference the Loader API. For .claude-output.json: accepted our deletion since the file is build metadata from a prior PR."
