  "summary": "Resolved 6 conflicts between feature/138-fileguard-sprint-1-issue-138 and origin/main. Used origin/main as the primary base for auth middleware (real DB integration, _is_jwt helper required by tests, TTL JWKS cache) and tenant schema (from_attributes=True for ORM conversion). Config used origin/main's uppercase field convention to stay compatible with existing non-conflicted files (main.py, db/session.py). pyproject.toml and requirements.txt were merged to include the comprehensive dependency set from origin/main with version pins from HEAD. Helper methods from HEAD (has_api_key_auth, has_oauth_auth) were preserved in the schema.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for auth.py (complete DB integration, tested helpers _is_jwt/_verify_api_key); chose origin/main for schemas/tenant.py (from_attributes=True required for ORM model_validate); chose origin/main uppercase field naming for config.py (compatible with non-conflicted main.py and db/session.py); merged dependencies in pyproject.toml and requirements.txt (union of both, taking higher version minimums, replacing PyJWT with python-jose since auth.py uses jose); used em-dash from origin/main for __init__.py (cosmetic only)"
