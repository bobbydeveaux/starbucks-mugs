  "summary": "Resolved 3 conflicts: accepted deletion of .claude-output.json (removed by origin/main), resolved fileguard/core/__init__.py docstring conflict by adopting origin/main's wording, and resolved fileguard/core/av_adapter.py by adopting origin/main's async interface (async scan/is_available, simple ScanResult with threat_name/raw_response fields) which is compatible with the existing ClamAVAdapter implementation and unit tests.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-output.json: accepted their deletion. For fileguard/core/__init__.py: chose origin/main's more descriptive docstring. For fileguard/core/av_adapter.py: chose origin/main's async interface over HEAD's sync interface, because the concrete ClamAVAdapter implementation and all unit tests depend on async scan/is_available methods and ScanResult fields (threat_name, raw_response) that match origin/main."
