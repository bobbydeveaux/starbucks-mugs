  "summary": "Resolved 1 'both added' conflict in go.mod. The feature branch had module name 'github.com/tripwire/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool' with pgx/testcontainers dependencies; origin/main had module name 'github.com/tripwire/agent' with only yaml.v3. The module name 'github.com/tripwire/agent' was kept because all agent code files (cmd/agent/main.go, internal/agent/agent.go, internal/agent/agent_test.go, internal/config/config_test.go) import from that path. All HEAD dependencies (pgx/v5, testcontainers-go) were retained. gopkg.in/yaml.v3 from main was added as a direct dependency since internal/config/config.go imports it. A secondary fix was applied to internal/server/storage/postgres_test.go to align its import path with the resolved module name.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes — adopted main's module name 'github.com/tripwire/agent' (consistent with 4/5 source files using that import path), kept HEAD's complete dependency set (pgx, testcontainers for postgres storage layer), added yaml.v3 from main as a direct dep (required by config package), and updated the one inconsistent import path in postgres_test.go to match"
