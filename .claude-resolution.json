  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicted files: .claude-output.json and docs/concepts/fileguard/README.md. The .claude-output.json conflict was between the HEAD FileGuard DocumentExtractor PR metadata and a completely unrelated NetworkWatcher/tripwire project entry from origin/main — HEAD was kept as it is the correct context for this branch. The README.md had three conflict sections in the Project Structure and documentation areas — both sides' FileGuard-specific additions were merged: rate_limit.py middleware, batch_job/compliance_report models, base.py, and integration test structure from main were combined with DocumentExtractor core module and test_document_extractor.py from HEAD; both the Document Extraction and AuditService documentation sections were preserved.",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-output.json: kept HEAD version (FileGuard DocumentExtractor context, correct for this branch; main version was a different project entirely). For docs/concepts/fileguard/README.md: merged both sides' additions — preserved all FileGuard-specific file entries and documentation sections from both branches to avoid losing any feature documentation."
