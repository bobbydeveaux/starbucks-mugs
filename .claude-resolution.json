  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in the two metadata files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json). HEAD contained resolution metadata from a prior merge attempt on this branch describing 2 metadata-file conflicts for PR 154; origin/main contained resolution metadata from a different branch's merge describing 4 fileguard source-file conflicts. Wrote fresh metadata reflecting the actual current merge state: only the 2 metadata files were conflicted, all other changes (new fileguard API/schema/test files and modifications to main.py, models, requirements) were already staged cleanly.",
  "strategyUsed": "wrote fresh metadata capturing the actual current merge state; preserved PR #154 and branch identity (feature/129-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-1-issue-129) from HEAD as correct for this merge; discarded origin/main's stale resolution summary which described a different branch's conflicts"
