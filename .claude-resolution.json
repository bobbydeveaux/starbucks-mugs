  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in 5 files: adopted origin/main's external-filter API for useCarCatalog (CatalogFilters parameter, ferrariCars/lamboCars return properties), adopted origin/main's data-driven rival-suggestion function for eraMatchSuggestion (selected: CarModel, rivalCatalog: CarModel[]), updated corresponding test files to match, and combined documentation sections from both branches in docs/components.md.",
  "strategyUsed": "For code files (useCarCatalog.ts, eraMatchSuggestion.ts) and their tests: chose origin/main's versions as they align with the CatalogFilters type already defined in types.ts, use imageUrl directly matching the actual JSON data files, and have cleaner external-filter APIs. For docs/components.md: preserved both branches' documentation by including all sections (useCarCatalog hook, FilterBar, eraMatchSuggestion utility, SearchBox, ComparisonPanel, NutritionRow utility, NutritionBar), updating the useCarCatalog and eraMatchSuggestion API docs to reflect origin/main's signatures."
