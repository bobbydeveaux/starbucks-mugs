For filterDrinks.ts, kept the 3-parameter function signature (drinks, category, query) used by the existing tests and useDrinks.ts hook, while also incorporating the CATEGORIES and CATEGORY_LABELS constants added by origin/main (required by FilterBar.tsx). For docs/components.md, preserved both the filterDrinks utility documentation from HEAD and the FilterBar/SearchBox/ComparisonPanel/NutritionRow/NutritionBar component documentation from origin/main.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes: kept HEAD function signature for filterDrinks (compatible with existing tests and useDrinks hook), added origin/main constants (CATEGORIES, CATEGORY_LABELS) needed by FilterBar; merged both documentation sections in docs/components.md"
