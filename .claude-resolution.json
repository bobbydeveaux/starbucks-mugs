  "summary": "Resolved 3 conflicted metadata files from previous CI-assisted merge runs: accepted origin/main deletion of .claude-output.json; resolved .claude-resolution.json by writing fresh resolution metadata; staged .conflict-info.json which had no conflict markers but was unmerged. No actual code files were conflicted in this merge.",
  "strategyUsed": "accepted deletion for .claude-output.json (deleted by origin/main); wrote new .claude-resolution.json capturing the current resolution; staged clean .conflict-info.json as-is. All real code changes (fileguard cloud PII adapters, prometheus SIEM alerts/tests, adapter __init__ exports) were non-conflicting and staged automatically by git."
