  "summary": "Resolved conflict in .claude-output.json by keeping the origin/main version. Our branch had deleted this file, but origin/main contains valid gRPC server task metadata that corresponds to the new files being merged in (cmd/server/main.go, internal/server/grpc/server.go, proto/alert.pb.go, etc.). Keeping the file preserves the task completion record for the gRPC server bootstrap task.",
