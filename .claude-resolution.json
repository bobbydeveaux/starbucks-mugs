  "summary": "Resolved 6 conflicted files: accepted deletion of .claude-output.json; kept both @tanstack/react-query and @types/react-window dependencies in package.json and package-lock.json; kept HEAD's AlertDashboardPage in App.tsx while also adding TripWireDashboardPage on a new /hosts route; kept HEAD's TanStack Query implementation of useAlerts.ts and its tests; merged both TripWire dashboard documentation sections in docs/components.md.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both branches' functionality where possible. For package.json/package-lock.json: kept both dependency additions (TanStack Query from HEAD, @types/react-window from main). For App.tsx: kept HEAD's AlertDashboardPage at /dashboard (our branch's primary sprint feature) and added TripWireDashboardPage at /hosts to preserve main branch's contribution. For useAlerts.ts and its tests: kept HEAD's TanStack Query REST API implementation since it is the primary feature of this sprint (feat: alert filtering controls and TanStack Query integration). For docs/components.md: merged both sections to document both the filter-based dashboard (HEAD) and the real-time trend chart components (main). Accepted deletion of .claude-output.json as removed by main."
