  "summary": "Resolved conflict in fileguard/core/adapters/__init__.py. The feature branch had a comprehensive version exporting ClamAVAdapter, CloudPIIAdapter, CloudPIIBackendError, GoogleDLPAdapter, and AWSMacieAdapter from well-named modules (google_dlp_adapter, aws_macie_adapter, etc.). Main had a minimal version only exporting GoogleDLPAdapter and AWSMacieAdapter from shorter module names (dlp_adapter, macie_adapter). Preserved the feature branch's complete version since all referenced adapter files exist on disk.",
  "strategyUsed": "kept HEAD (feature branch) version — it preserves more functionality by including the ClamAV adapter and CloudPIIAdapter base class exports, while main only re-exported two classes with shorter module names; all underlying adapter files exist on disk so no imports are broken"
