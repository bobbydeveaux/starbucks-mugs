  "filesResolved": 2,
  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicted metadata files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json). The .claude-resolution.json file had conflict markers between two prior AI-assisted merge session summaries (HEAD described a fileguard/middleware.md pytest command resolution; origin/main described an earlier metadata file merge). The .conflict-info.json file had no conflict markers and already contained the correct current-session metadata (PR #204, feature/144-fileguard-sprint-2-issue-144).",
  "strategyUsed": "For .claude-resolution.json: wrote a fresh resolution summary for the current session rather than attempting to merge two stale prior-session descriptions. For .conflict-info.json: the file already contained the correct origin/main content (matching the current PR and branch context) with no conflict markers, so it was staged as-is."
