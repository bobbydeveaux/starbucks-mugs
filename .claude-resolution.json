  "summary": "Resolved 2 metadata file conflicts in .claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json. HEAD contained AI-resolution metadata from a prior merge attempt on this branch (describing a go.mod conflict for PR 154); origin/main contained metadata from a different branch's merge resolution (describing a fileguard/db/__init__.py conflict for PR 156/feature-133). The correct PR context (154) and branch identity (feature/129-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-1-issue-129) was preserved from HEAD, and the conflict metadata was updated to reflect the actual conflicted files in this merge.",
  "strategyUsed": "wrote fresh metadata capturing the actual current merge state — adopted HEAD's PR number (154) and branch name as correct for this merge; updated conflictedFiles and conflictCount to match the two metadata files that were actually in conflict (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json)"
