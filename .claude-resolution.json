  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in DownloadButton.test.tsx and Preview.test.tsx by adopting the origin/main versions, which feature better test isolation, more comprehensive coverage, and improved testing practices (per-test vi.doMock + vi.resetModules for DownloadButton; mocked parseMarkdown dependency for Preview). All scenarios covered by HEAD are also covered by the origin/main test suites, plus additional cases.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main for both files — origin/main tests are strictly more comprehensive: DownloadButton tests use per-test module mocking (vi.doMock) and userEvent instead of shared vi.mock + fireEvent, adding 'button enabled by default' and 'restores button after success' cases; Preview tests mock parseMarkdown for proper unit isolation and add 'pane header', 'paragraph text', 'whitespace input', and 'prop changes' cases not present in HEAD."
