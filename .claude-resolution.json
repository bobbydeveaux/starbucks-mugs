  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both sides where additive: (1) .claude-output.json — kept ours (main deleted it, our branch has valid PR metadata); (2) .review-feedback.txt — merged brief HEAD summary with full detailed review from main; (3) components.md — kept our version which has the complete test coverage table (main had an empty section); (4) package.json — adopted version 0.1.0 from main, merged scripts (kept test:watch from HEAD, added lint/typecheck from main), merged devDependencies (added eslint packages from main); (5) package-lock.json — used main's version via git checkout --theirs (consistent with adopting eslint packages); (6) App.tsx — added XSS-safe bullet point from main to the sample markdown feature list; (7) vite.config.ts — added css:false and include pattern from main to the test config."
