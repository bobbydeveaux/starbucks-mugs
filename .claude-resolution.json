  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in src/pages/CostaVsStarbucksPage.tsx (import conflict) and docs/components.md (documentation sections conflict). Both sides added independent, non-overlapping features so all content was preserved.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes: HEAD added FilterBar/SearchBox imports and docs; origin/main added ComparisonPanel/NutritionBar/NutritionRow imports and docs. All were kept since the JSX body already used all three components and the doc sections are independent."
