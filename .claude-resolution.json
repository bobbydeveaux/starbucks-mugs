  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicts across 3 files plus 1 deletion: accepted origin/main's deletion of .claude-output.json (build artifact); resolved cmd/agent/main.go by adopting origin/main's unconditional NetworkWatcher creation (safe by design) plus the buildFileWatchers registration it added; resolved internal/config/config.go by using origin/main's cleaner variable names (validProtocols/validDirections), omitempty YAML tags, and 'both' as the default protocol; resolved agent-core.md by aligning docs with the chosen code defaults ('both' protocol default, inline defaults description) and merging startup sequence sections to include both network and file watcher steps.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preferred origin/main for code-level decisions (unconditional watcher creation, variable naming, protocol default 'both', omitempty tags) as it is the more complete and idiomatic implementation; merged documentation sections to accurately reflect the resolved code behaviour from both branches."
