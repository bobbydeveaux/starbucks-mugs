  "summary": "Resolved two conflicts: (1) src/utils/filterDrinks.ts — both branches added the file independently; merged by using origin/main's richer version which includes the CATEGORIES and CATEGORY_LABELS constants required by FilterBar.tsx on our branch, while preserving the shared filterDrinks function. (2) .claude-output.json — deleted by our branch, present in origin/main; respected our branch's deletion by running git rm.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes where possible — used origin/main's more complete filterDrinks.ts (better JSDoc, Category import, CATEGORIES and CATEGORY_LABELS constants needed by FilterBar); honoured our branch's intent to delete .claude-output.json (metadata file from a prior PR with no functional relevance to this branch)"
