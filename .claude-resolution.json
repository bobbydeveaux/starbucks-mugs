  "summary": "Resolved conflict in proto/alert.proto by adopting the origin/main schema, which is consistent with the existing generated Go bindings (alert.pb.go, alert_grpc.pb.go) and the gRPC service implementation (alert_service.go). The HEAD version used incompatible message names (AgentRegistration, ServerAck) and a different go_package path that would have broken the already-generated and implemented service code.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for proto/alert.proto — its message types (RegisterRequest, RegisterResponse, ServerCommand, AgentEvent with timestamp_us/event_detail_json) match the generated Go stubs and the AlertService implementation already committed to the branch; the HEAD schema was incompatible with those files"
