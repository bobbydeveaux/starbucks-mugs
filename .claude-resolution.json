  "summary": "Resolved one conflict in .claude-output.json. The file was deleted by our branch (feature/183-fileguard-sprint-3-issue-183) but the incoming merge had a version from a previous AI-assisted process about a different feature (dashboard-ui, Closes #258). The deletion was accepted as the correct resolution.",
  "strategyUsed": "kept our deletion of .claude-output.json — the file is a generated output artifact from a previous PR workflow run (unrelated to the current branch work), and our branch intentionally removed it; accepting the deletion avoids carrying over stale metadata from a different feature"
