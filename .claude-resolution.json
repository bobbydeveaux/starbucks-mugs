Both files contained stale AI-assisted merge metadata from prior resolutions on different branches. No source code conflicts were present; the other staged files (docs, audit.py, pyproject.toml, integration tests) were already merged without conflicts.",
  "strategyUsed": "Wrote fresh resolution metadata reflecting the current merge state (PR #197, 2 conflicted metadata files). HEAD described resolving file-watcher doc conflicts; origin/main described resolving PR #193 metadata conflicts. Since both were stale descriptions of earlier resolutions, a new accurate summary was authored. For .conflict-info.json, the HEAD version (prNumber: 197, headBranch: feature/161-tripwire-cybersecurity-tool-sprint-2-issue-161) was used as it correctly identifies this PR."
