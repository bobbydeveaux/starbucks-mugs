  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in src/hooks/useComparison.ts and src/hooks/useComparison.test.ts. The core conflict was a naming difference (winners vs stats) and two different implementation approaches. Adopted origin/main's winnerFor helper function and stats property name (cleaner API), while merging in extra test coverage from HEAD (deselect-lambo test, per-field type assertions in shape test).",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes — used origin/main's stats naming and winnerFor helper for the hook implementation; merged HEAD's additional test cases (deselecting lambo, type assertions) into origin/main's cleaner test structure using its fixture names (ferrari/lambo/ferrariTwin)"
