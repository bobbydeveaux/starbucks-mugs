  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in src/utils/imageUrl.ts and src/utils/imageUrl.test.ts. The HEAD branch had a robust URL-generation implementation (special-char removal, step-by-step normalization) with comprehensive fixture-based tests. origin/main introduced brand-prefix stripping (e.g. 'Ferrari 488' → '488') and brand.toLowerCase() in URLs, with simpler tests. Both sets of functionality were preserved in the merge.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes: kept HEAD's robust special-character removal and comprehensive test suite; added origin/main's brand-prefix stripping logic and brand.toLowerCase() URL normalization; added origin/main's brand-prefix test cases as a new describe block. All 76 imageUrl tests pass."
