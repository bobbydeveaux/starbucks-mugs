  "summary": "Resolved 16 merge conflicts between feature/46-costa-vs-starbucks-sprint-1-issue-46 (HEAD) and origin/main. HEAD contained a more complete implementation (useDrinks hook, filter, useMemo/useCallback, CSP header, data-selected attribute, full comparison panel) while main had earlier scaffold code with useful additions (CSS layers, image display in DrinkCard, drink count in BrandSection, toggle deselect behaviour, richer JSDoc comments). Strategy was to keep HEAD as the base and merge the best improvements from main into it.",
  "strategyUsed": "Kept HEAD for: .claude-output.json (current PR metadata), index.html (CSP security header), package.json (vite@6, full eslint toolchain, test:ui script), postcss.config.js, tailwind.config.ts (flat color tokens matching component usage), tsconfig.json (full compiler config), src/main.tsx (named container variable, no .tsx extension), src/App.tsx (useDrinks hook, filter state, useMemo, useCallback, full comparison panel). Merged from main into HEAD: .gitignore (added *.tsbuildinfo, .env patterns), tsconfig.node.json (added noUnusedLocals/noUnusedParameters/noFallthroughCasesInSwitch), vite.config.ts (added vitest reference comment), src/App.tsx handleSelect (added deselect-on-same-click toggle), src/types.ts (added JSDoc comments from main, kept optional image field from HEAD), src/index.css (kept CSS layers structure from main, added box-sizing from HEAD), src/components/DrinkCard.tsx (added image section and CATEGORY_LABELS from main, kept data-selected/aria-pressed from HEAD), src/components/DrinkCatalog.tsx (added drink count display and per-brand emptyText from main, kept aria-labelledby from HEAD)."
