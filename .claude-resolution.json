  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes: combined AlertEvent+Watcher interface (HEAD) with EventType+FileEvent types (origin/main) in watcher.go since file_watcher.go depends on all four types; merged origin/main's more complete interface description and queue package section into agent-core.md; kept HEAD's detailed Watcher interface docs in file-watcher.md while using origin/main's actual InotifyWatcher API content where HEAD had stub placeholders"
