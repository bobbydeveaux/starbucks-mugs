  "summary": "Resolved 2 conflicted metadata files (.claude-resolution.json and .conflict-info.json). The HEAD version of .claude-resolution.json described a prior session that resolved 1 file (docs/concepts/tripwire-cybersecurity-tool/file-watcher.md, merging InotifyWatcher and KqueueWatcher documentation). The origin/main version described a different prior session that resolved 2 metadata files (combining two earlier resolution histories). The current session merges these two divergent resolution histories into a unified summary.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes — combined the conflicting resolution summaries from HEAD (1 file resolved: file-watcher.md documentation merge) and origin/main (2 metadata files resolved from an earlier session) into a single coherent description. .conflict-info.json had no conflict markers and was staged as-is."
