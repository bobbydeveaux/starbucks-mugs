  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in fileguard/main.py, fileguard/models/__init__.py, fileguard/models/tenant_config.py, and migrations/env.py by merging feature-branch auth additions with main-branch model/migration improvements.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes throughout: (1) fileguard/main.py - kept AuthMiddleware import+registration from HEAD and settings import+redis init comment from origin/main, both are required for the app to function; (2) fileguard/models/__init__.py - chose origin/main's complete ORM registry (all 4 models + docstring) over HEAD's stub with only TenantConfig; (3) fileguard/models/tenant_config.py - merged HEAD's OAuth fields (jwks_url, client_id, UniqueConstraint) with origin/main's timestamps, relationships, and server defaults, using fileguard.db.base.Base for consistency with migrations/env.py; (4) migrations/env.py - discarded HEAD's duplicate import block (already set above the conflict) and kept origin/main's DATABASE_URL environment override (12-factor app pattern)"
