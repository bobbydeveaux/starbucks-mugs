  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in eraMatchSuggestion.ts and eraMatchSuggestion.test.ts by choosing the origin/main version for both files. The two branches had a semantic difference: HEAD implemented a fallback to the full catalog when no eraRivals matched, while origin/main strictly returns null in that case. The origin/main approach is more principled for a pre-curated dataset, keeping the suggestion logic deterministic and data-driven.",
  "strategyUsed": "chose origin/main for both files — the stricter null-return behavior (no full-catalog fallback) is more appropriate for pre-curated eraRivals data; the origin/main implementation also uses a Map for O(1) ID lookups and the origin/main test suite is more comprehensive with nested describe blocks covering all edge cases"
