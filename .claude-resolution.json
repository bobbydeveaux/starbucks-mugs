  "summary": "Resolved 3 conflicted files: merged task metadata in .claude-output.json combining both PR outputs; combined WebSocket/AlertFeed and multi-host selector documentation into a single cohesive dashboard-ui.md; resolved App.tsx by using the origin/main TripWireDashboardPage component for the /dashboard route since both page files exist in the filesystem",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes — combined filesChanged and docsReviewed lists in .claude-output.json; kept both feature documentation sections in dashboard-ui.md (WebSocket integration + multi-host selector); chose origin/main component name (TripWireDashboardPage) for App.tsx route as it represents the approved main-branch state while the feature-branch TripwireDashboardPage file remains available"
