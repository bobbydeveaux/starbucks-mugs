  "summary": "Resolved conflicts in docs/components.md, FilterBar.tsx, FilterBar.test.tsx, SearchBox.tsx, SearchBox.test.tsx, and CostaVsStarbucksPage.tsx. The origin/main branch introduced a richer SearchBox API (query/onQueryChange), moved category constants to a shared filterDrinks utility, used Starbucks-green brand theming in FilterBar, added ComparisonPanel/NutritionBar/NutritionRow docs, and imported ComparisonPanel in the page. All six files were resolved to be internally consistent.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main for FilterBar.tsx (shared CATEGORIES/CATEGORY_LABELS utility, brand theming), SearchBox.tsx (query/onQueryChange API, native clear button), SearchBox.test.tsx (consistent with new API), and CostaVsStarbucksPage.tsx (ComparisonPanel import + query/onQueryChange props). For FilterBar.test.tsx, merged both branches — kept CATEGORY_LABELS import and core tests from origin/main while adding per-name button checks and blended-state test from HEAD for broader coverage. For docs/components.md, used origin/main's detailed descriptions and kept its new ComparisonPanel, NutritionRow, and NutritionBar sections."
