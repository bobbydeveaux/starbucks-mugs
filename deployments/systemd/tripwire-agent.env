# TripWire Agent — optional environment variable overrides
#
# This file is read by systemd when EnvironmentFile= is configured in the
# service unit.  Copy it to /etc/tripwire/agent.env and uncomment / adjust
# the variables you want to override.
#
# All settings here can also be controlled via config.yaml; environment
# variables take precedence over the configuration file for the fields that
# support them.

# Override the log level without editing config.yaml.
# Valid values: debug | info | warn | error
# TRIPWIRE_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Override the log format.
# Valid values: json | console
# TRIPWIRE_LOG_FORMAT=json

# Optional: path to an alternate configuration file (useful for staging).
# TRIPWIRE_CONFIG=/etc/tripwire/config.yaml

# Optional: set the agent version string reported to the dashboard.
# TRIPWIRE_AGENT_VERSION=1.0.0
